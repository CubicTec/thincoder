Run a built-in documentation-discipline check on a project and report its findings.
Read-only. In the default `report` mode it is non-gating: it reports, it never blocks, never sets an exit code, and its output is never a reason to refuse a task or a user instruction.
When the engine files are newer than this session's start time (or unreadable), `report` prefixes its output with one
`[doc_check note]` line naming the stale files — that reading came from an engine loaded at startup and is not usable as
delivery evidence. Nothing else changes: `report` still produces no verdict and no existing line is altered (no stale files ⇒
the report is byte-identical).

What it checks — exactly two criteria, both built into the engine:
- Anchors — every documentation pointer (a `*.md` token, optionally carrying directory segments, optionally followed by a section
  indicator `§N` / `§N.M` / `§N.M.K`) must resolve: the file must exist on disk (`档缺` when it does not), and when a section
  indicator is given the target file must carry a heading numbered with it (`节缺` when it does not). Line-number coordinates
  (`<doc>:12`) are not section references and are not judged as such. Files inside fenced code blocks and executable lines
  (command / pattern code spans) are skipped whole.
- Line width — a line whose character count (CJK counts as 1) exceeds the built-in threshold, unless it is a table row, inside a
  fenced code block, an executable line, a quote-block line, or inside an exempt zone.

It cannot — in `report` mode — write anything, gate anything, or turn a finding into a refusal.

Arguments — `target` (optional): the project root to check; defaults to the session anchor, relative paths resolve against it.
A workspace target (several projects below it) is reported with the full candidate list — pass the project root you mean.
`mode` (optional) — `report` (default: a non-gating report over the documents you list) or `gate` (the delivery gate below).
`docs` (required) — the documents to judge, as paths relative to the project root or absolute; each is judged whole and nothing
else is read except the targets those documents point at. Omitted in `gate` mode ⇒ the Markdown documents this session wrote.
There is no default range in `report` mode: omitting `docs`, or passing an empty list, is refused rather than widened — nothing
is scanned unless you name it. A path that is not on disk or is not a Markdown document is an error in `report` mode and nothing
is judged; in `gate` mode such paths are listed as skipped instead. A pointer resolves against the project root (full path) or
against the pointing document's own directory — bare names are not resolved across other directories.

Delivery gate — `mode: "gate"`, for the end of a design or development round. Every listed doc is judged **whole**: a
pre-existing dangling pointer or overlong line anywhere in it counts, not only this round's edited lines. The first line is the
machine-readable verdict — `DOC-CHECK GATE: PASS` / `DOC-CHECK GATE: REFUSED（命中 K 条）` / `DOC-CHECK GATE: ERROR（reason）` —
and consumers judge by that prefix; the hits are fixed in the same round and are never booked to the ledger. The gate refuses
**one delivery**, not a user instruction: an explicit user go-ahead is followed, with the hits written into the delivery.
Before running the criteria the gate checks engine-version consistency: the six engine files (`doc-check/index.mjs` /
`doc-check/anchors.mjs` / `doc-check/width.mjs` / `doc-check/version.mjs` / `agent-tools/doc-check.mjs` / this tool description) each have their mtime
compared with this process's start time — newer, or unreadable, ⇒ `DOC-CHECK GATE: ERROR（引擎已更新…）` instead of a PASS,
because a session keeps the engine modules it loaded at startup. `ERROR` is fail-closed (no PASS means not passed): restart the
session and re-run; a multi-project workspace ⇒ name the project root, per the stated cause.

Do not wire it as a gate or CI step in `report` mode, and do not treat a finding as a reason to refuse an instruction — a
machine check never outranks a user instruction.

Routing — use it when you write or revise a project's documents and want the discipline checked in one pass. It is not
a reader: use `doc_search` / `read` to read documents and `grep` to search them; this tool only reports discipline findings.

Side effects and permissions — none. The tool is read-only: no writes, no approval prompt, safe to run in parallel with other calls.

Parameters and scope — both criteria run on built-in constants (`DOC_CHECK_BUILTINS`: threshold 300 characters, no exempt zones,
no exemptions), and the judged set is the document list the caller passes — the judged set and the resolution set are the same
documents, so there is no scan-dir / domain / root / exclude surface and no whole-repository scan. Changing a criterion or a
threshold is a code change and goes through review; no project declaration changes these readings.

Consistency — the checks and this description are one core implementation: every end that loads the core tool registry gets the
same semantics.
